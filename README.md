# Standard-Bank-Corporate-Investment-Banking-Job-Simulation-on-Forage-
This repository contains my work from the *Standard Bank Corporate Investment Banking Job Simulation* on Forage, completed in March 2025. This simulation provided hands-on experience in debt solutions analysis, financial modeling, and credit assessment, simulating the responsibilities of a Debt Solutions Analyst.

## Project Overview

As part of this job simulation, I assessed a hypothetical client, **Sea Harvest**, who required a lending solution. The tasks involved:

- **Company Profile Preparation:** Compiling a **1-page company profile** for the credit committee.
- **Financial Research & Analysis:** Using annual reports and third-party sources to develop a well-rounded view of the client’s business and future performance.
- **Financial Modeling:** Building an **Excel-based financial model** to forecast the client’s expected financial performance.
- **Market Insights Presentation:** Presenting current market affairs and their implications to my manager.

## Key Learning Outcomes

During this simulation, I developed key skills in:

- **Credit & Risk Analysis:** Understanding lending solutions and assessing client creditworthiness.
- **Financial Modeling:** Creating projections for a client’s future financial performance using Excel.
- **Market Research & Analysis:** Extracting insights from financial reports and third-party data sources.
- **Presentation & Communication:** Preparing concise reports for the credit committee and delivering key insights to senior management.
